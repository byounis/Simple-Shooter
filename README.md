# Simple-Shooter

This is a work in progress. 

A third-person shooter built on the Unreal game engine. The goal of this project was to improve my C++ skills and expand my game development skills into Unreal. I set up the animation blending logic, game loop, enemy AI behaviour and hit scan guns. 

Only sample code has been included in this repository due to the size of the project and github's limitation of free repo size. If you would like access to the entire project, please reach out to me and I can supply a link.
